<h2>Watch on YouTube</h2>
This repository was created for my Tkinter GUI YouTube tutorial:

<br>
<b>author:</b> Mariya Sha
<br>
<br>
<b> dependencies: </b>

- Tkinter
- Pillow (PIL)
- NumPy
- Pyglet (optional: used for Windows custom fonts)

<b>database webscraped from:</b>
<br>
https://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/recipedb/
<br>
using MechanicalSoup and SQLite
<br>
<br>
find out how you can webscrape your own database with those libraries
<br>
by following this tutorial of mine: https://youtu.be/MkGQmZoMuRM

<h2>Project Directories</h2>
the following directories require a detailed overview:

<h3>starter_files</h3>

this directory contains the starter files required to follow my YouTube tutorial.

- 2 logos inside the <b>assets</b> folder
- 2 .ttf fonts inside the <b>fonts</b> folder (downloaded from Google Fonts)
- 1 database file inside the <b>data</b> folder
- 1 .png wireframe inside the root folder.
- 1 .py file inside the root folder containing the most basic commands to run a Tkinter window.

<h3>complete_project_WINDOWS</h3>

this directory contains the complete application, created by following the YouTube tutorial.
<br>
as this app uses custom fonts, it's suitable for Windows users only.
<br>
an non-OS-dependant version of this project will be uploaded shortly.
<br>
in addition to all the files specified in starter_files, this directory contains:

- requirements.txt generated by "pip freeze"
- requirements_conda.txt generated by "conda list" especially for Anaconda users

<b>please note!</b> I've added some horizontal padding with <b>padx=25</b> both for the title and ingredients.
<br>
everything else is a 100% match to the code presented in the tutorial (+ helpful comments)

<h3>relationalDB_complete_project_WINDOWS</h3>

this directory contains the updated application (January, 2023)
<br>
designed with a relational database rather than the database that was shown in the YouTube tutorial.
<br>
recipes.db now contains 2 tables:

- recipes (includes a primary_key column)
- ingredients (foreign key: recipe_key)

as a result, 2 functions were slightly modified:

- fetch_db()
- pre_process(recipe_name, table_records)
